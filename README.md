# ChestX-RayDiagnosis
CNN with Tensorflow and Keras used for classification and prediction of new images

Website ​Kaggle.com ​offers a 42-gigabyte data set from The National Institutes of Health that contains 112,120 PNG files of chest x-rays from over 30,805 patients [4]. It also contains a CSV file that identifies the medical condition found in each x-ray. The labels are expected to be over 90% accurate and suitable for weakly-supervised learning. The X-rays have one or more findings (diagnoses)
