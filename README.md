# Autonomous Chest X-Ray Diagnosis
Predicting Lung Disease from X-Ray Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Website ​Kaggle.com ​offers a 42-gigabyte data set from The National Institutes of Health that contains 112,120 PNG files of chest x-rays from over 30,805 patients [4]. It also contains a CSV file that identifies the medical condition found in each x-ray. The labels are expected to be over 90% accurate and suitable for weakly-supervised learning. The X-rays have one or more findings (diagnoses)
